      <p>Passionate web developer with expertise in front-end technologies and UI/UX design. Experienced in building responsive, user-friendly web applications. Focused on continuous learning and improving coding skills. I am a dedicated and skilled software developer with 2 to 3 years of professional experience in the tech industry. My journey began with a strong foundation in computer science, as I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Elma University in 2023. Throughout my career, I have focused on building efficient, user-friendly web applications, specializing in modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and advanced frameworks like Next.js with TypeScript.

        In addition to my expertise in software development, I am also the proud owner of a garment factory. This dual role has given me a unique perspective, allowing me to integrate my technical abilities with practical business management. My experience in the garment industry complements my development skills, enabling me to approach projects with a blend of creativity and strategic thinking.
        
        I am passionate about crafting innovative solutions and enjoy tackling complex challenges. Whether I’m coding the backend of a web application or designing an elegant user interface, I strive for excellence in every detail. With a commitment to lifelong learning, I continuously update my skill set to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and finding ways to enhance productivity through smart tools and systems.</p>
